Description: Utilities for prompting the user for credentials or a passphrase, for
    example to authenticate with a server or read a private key. Includes reliable
    native programs for MacOS and Windows, no widgets are required. Password entry 
    can be invoked in two different ways: either directly from R via the askpass()
    function, but also indirectly as password-entry back-end via the SSH_ASKPASS 
    and GIT_ASPKASS environment variables. Thereby the user can be prompted for 
    credentials or a passphrase when R calls out to git or ssh-agent.
